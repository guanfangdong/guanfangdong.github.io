**PhD. Computing Science** Sep 2020 - Dec 2024 <br>
Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. <br>
Grade: GPA: 4.0/4.0<br>
During the first two years of my Ph.D. studies, I focused on research related to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Subsequently, my research interest was captured by distribution learning, developed in our laboratory. I proposed many algorithms for explicit and implicit distribution learning, with corresponding papers published or in the process of being published in several highly reputable journals and conferences.

**MSc. Information Technology** Sep 2019 - Jun 2020 <br>
School of Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. <br>
Grade: GPA: 4.2/4.0 (0.2 is the bonus)<br>
I pursued my master's degree at HKUST and was honored with the Top Student Award. During this period, I had research opportunities under the supervision of Prof. Long Quan and Prof. Nevin L. Zhang, respectively. The work conducted during these research periods has been published in patents.

**BSc. Computing Science** Sep 2014 - Apr 2019 <br>
Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta. <br>
Grade: GPA: 3.5/4.0<br>
During my undergraduate studies, I didn't confine myself solely to the coursework but actively engaged in various independent game development projects, an area that greatly interested me. However, the time commitment required for development led to a relatively lower GPA during my undergraduate years. I led the development of four independent games and co-founded a studio-qualified company with friends. One of our games was honored with the title of Game of the Year by the University of Alberta. Despite not having a high GPA, the experiences in learning and development equipped me with a strong foundation in algorithms and mathematics, which have greatly benefited my future academic pursuits.
