### Teaching Experience

**Teaching Assistant, CMPUT 414, Introduction to Multimedia Technology, Sep 2020 - Present**<br>
Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta<br>
During my doctoral studies, I served as a teaching assistant for CMPUT 414. My responsibilities included leading discussions during approximately three to four lecture sessions per semester on topics such as diffusion and other recent advancements in multimedia. Additionally, I graded assignments and exams, and guided student groups in project work and paper writing. Notably, one of the papers I supervised on motion reconstruction has been published.

**Academic Tutor, CMPUT 175, Introduction to the Foundations of Computation II, Jan 2021 - Nov 2022**<br>
Easy 4.0 Education Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada<br>
At the onset of my doctoral studies, I served as a tutor for CMPUT 175. My primary role was to assist students in solidifying and reviewing course materials covered in class. Several students achieved grades of A and A+ with my tutoring assistance. However, due to increasing academic research commitments, I was unable to continue in the role of a tutor.
